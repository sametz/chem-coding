Drafts folder mirroring structure seems clumsy.
Probably use a "Drafts" branch then push to main when good enough.

Name of repo? 
If thinking of CFC, will be guides and tutorials/small code examples.
Don't create GH repo until you've settled on these things.

resources: awesome x type lists
how_to: step by step guides on how to do common tasks
guides: e.g. how to choose a language to learn
example_code: scripts or small programs (or links to them)
