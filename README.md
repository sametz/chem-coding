This is a collection of notes that I've either written for myself, or others. 
For now it is a "brain dump" for me to refer back to, 
but I've made it a public repository 
with the goal of eventually having materials worth sharing.

The `guides` folder is for generic guides on a variety of topics.

The `how-to` folder is for guides on how to accomplish specific tasks.

The `references` folder is for "Awesome X"-style collections of references 
on various topics.
