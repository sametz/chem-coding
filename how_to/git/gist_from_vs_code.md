# How to Work With Gists from VS Code

It is possible to work with Gists on GitHub directly from VS Code. 
When you save your edits, they are automatically pushed to GitHub.
This means you can use Gists as syncronized lists with a cloud back-up.

For now, this how-to is mostly a stub that recommends one particular extension for VS Code.

1. Install the GistPad addon for VS Code.

2. Click on the GistPad icon in the left toolbar of VS Code,
and sign in to GitHub.

3. You are now able to edit your own Gists, create new Gists, and view other Gists that you have starred. GistPad has other features, such as creating "Scratch Notes" or editing your repos with out cloning them.
